# Large Sieve (multiplicative, for primitive Dirichlet characters)

A **sorry-free** Lean 4 / Mathlib formalization of the multiplicative large sieve
inequality for primitive Dirichlet characters:

```
∑_{q ≤ Q} ∑*_{χ mod q} (q/φ(q)) · ‖∑_{H < n ≤ H+N} cₙ χ(n)‖²
      ≤ (8π² + 2) · (N + Q²) · ∑_{H < n ≤ H+N} ‖cₙ‖²
```

where `∑*` ranges over any family of **primitive** characters mod `q`.

The top-level result is `multiplicative_large_sieve_gallagher` in
[`LargeSieve/Multiplicative.lean`](LargeSieve/Multiplicative.lean). It depends
only on the standard axioms `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`
(verified with `#print axioms`) — no `sorry`.

## Why primitive characters

The unrestricted statement (summing over *all* characters mod `q`, including the
principal character) is **false**: the principal character contributes ~N²/2 to
the left-hand side, which breaks the bound for large `Q`. The classical
multiplicative large sieve — and the downstream Bombieri–Vinogradov machinery —
restricts to primitive characters (the `∑*` of the literature). This is why the
`hS : ∀ q, ∀ χ ∈ S q, χ.IsPrimitive` hypothesis is required.

## The constant

The constant `8π² + 2 ≈ 81` comes from **Gallagher's 1967** proof of the additive
large sieve (a Sobolev/FTC argument), which avoids the Beurling–Selberg extremal
functions needed for the sharp constant `N − 1 + δ⁻¹`. For Bombieri–Vinogradov
the value of the constant is irrelevant — it only affects the implied constant in
the error term — so the non-sharp Gallagher constant is sufficient.

## Building

Uses Lean `v4.32.0-rc1` (see `lean-toolchain`). This is a standalone Lake
package (it does **not** yet share a toolchain with the surrounding
Bombieri–Vinogradov project, which pins an earlier Lean):

```bash
cd large-sieve-v4.32
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

## Relation to `BV/Axioms.lean`

This is a standalone v4.32 reference copy. The v4.28 version of the same proof lives at
the repo root (`LargeSieve/`) and is what actually discharges the `large_sieve` axiom in
`BV/Axioms.lean` (turning it into a theorem).

Note the original axiom summed over `DirichletCharacter ℚ q` for **all** characters,
which is not provable; the discharged statement is restricted to **primitive**
characters and is `ℂ`-valued, matching the actual downstream usage (`LambdaFlat.lean`,
`Flat/Perron.lean` already filter on `χ.IsPrimitive`).
